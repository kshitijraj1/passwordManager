![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.7%2B-blue)

A simple command-line password manager to securely store and retrieve passwords for various accounts.
## Features

- User registration and login
- Password encryption for secure storage
- Save passwords for different accounts
- Retrieve passwords for stored accounts

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- [cryptography](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/password-manager.git
   cd password-manager
Install the required cryptography library:
pip install cryptography


Usage
Run the password manager:
python password_manager.py
Choose the appropriate option from the menu:

1: Login
2: Sign up
3: Exit
If you are a new user, select "Sign up" to create an account. Otherwise, choose "Login" to access the password manager.

Once logged in, you can save and retrieve passwords for different accounts.

To exit the password manager, select "Logout" from the menu.

Security Considerations
The passwords are encrypted using the cryptography library before storage to enhance security. However, this project lacks other essential security features such as strong key management and multi-factor authentication, which are necessary for a production-level password manager.

Never share or expose the password_manager.key file or the passwords.json file to others. These files contain sensitive information and should be kept private.

Always handle passwords and encryption keys with utmost care. Store them securely and avoid hardcoding them in the source code.
